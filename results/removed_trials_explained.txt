confusion_lines_count: Number of trials excluded due to excessive direction changes with the joystick
(more than 3 for adults, more than 4 for kids).

zero_count: Number of trials containing zero values, typically caused by pressing the fire button too early.
In these trials, only the completion RT (the third measure) is retained for analysis.

initial_RT: Number of excluded initial reaction time (RT) values.

movement_duration: Number of excluded first full movement RT values.

completion_time: Number of excluded completion RT values.

low_accuracy_random_mistakes: True if the initial RT accuracy rate is below 50% and the mistakes are randomly
distributed across conditions. False otherwise.

more_than_50%_removal_flag: True if more than 50% of the values were removed for any of the three RT measures
(compared to the total number of trials). False otherwise.

large_outliers_number: True if the participant is identified as an outlier in terms of the number of excluded trials
(in any of the three RT measures) compared to the group. False otherwise.
